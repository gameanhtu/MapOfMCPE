The map took approximately 1 year to build, and is always a work in progress, but all open pavilions have complete interiors with functioning rides you can enjoy. I hope you enjoy my hard work, and have a good day!\n\nThis map was a personal endeavor by myself. Ever since I discovered the past version of the theme park I love most, Epcot, as it looked in 1989 with all the original pavilions, I have always wanted to build my own version as it looked back in 1989 to enjoy and modify. Now I want to share my hard work with the world, so everyone can enjoy the promise of a bright future!\n\nThanks for checking out my map, and welcome to the 21st century!\n\nPhotos of some of the pavilions:\n\nSpaceship Earth"
